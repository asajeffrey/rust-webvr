# rust-webvr
Safe rust API that provides a way to interact with Virtual Reality headsets and integration with vendor specific SDKs like OpenVR, Oculus and GoogleVR (Daydream). The API is inspired on the easy to use WebVR API but adapted to Rust design patterns.

It's used in the WebVR Core implementation for Servo browser. This module can be tested outside of Servo and even be used on any vanilla Rust app.
